quantitative data and description', 'In contrast', 'data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e', 'g', '', 'from images', 'text', 'sensors', 'transactions', 'customer information',

Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name to computer science', 'In 1996', 'the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic', 'However', 'the definition was still in flux', 'After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing', 'in 1997 C', 'F', 'Jeff Wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science', 'He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes', 'such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data', 'In 1998',

involves working with larger', 'more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze', 'Data scientists often work with unstructured data such as text or

preprocessing', 'feature engineering', 'and model selection', 'For instance', 'a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences', 'While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data', 'data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions', 'Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data', 'selecting appropriate analytical techniques', 'and
